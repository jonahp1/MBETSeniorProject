Files et al for my undergraduate thesis project.

Hello! 

Thank you for visiting this repo. All files/project are part of a larger project that I completed in partial fulfillment of my undergraduate thesis project.

A few housekeeping notes:

All ".scd" files are SuperCollider code. They will run in the SuperCollider IDE (or any other text editor setup w/ sclang, I believe). To run, they must be "copy/pasted" into the IDE (or text editor) and then evaluated after the .fork method.

The folders contain projects built in Max/MSP. Within them, you'll find standalone Applications, as well as the compressed text files (contained in ".pdf" documents). You'll need Max 8 to view the patch via the compressed text... To do this, copy the text, then open Max. Go to "File" and select "New From Clipboard in the top menu to open.

Thank you! Have fun, feel free to use in whatever way you want, and any feedback or suggestions are welcomed!
