Files et al. for my undergraduate thesis project.

//============================================================================================================================

Hello! 

//============================================================================================================================

Thank you for visiting this repository. All files/project are part of a larger project that I completed in partial fulfillment of my undergraduate thesis project.

//============================================================================================================================

A few housekeeping notes:

//============================================================================================================================

Regarding the folder "SuperColliderCode" : All ".scd" files are SuperCollider code. They will run in the SuperCollider IDE (or any other text editor setup w/ sclang, I believe). To run, they must be "copy/pasted" into the IDE (or text editor) and then    evaluated after the .fork method.
    
  Notes on SC projects:
    Noise Resonator - 
    Granular Pitch Shifter - 
    wtMouse - 
    Live Playground - 
  
//============================================================================================================================

Regarding the folder "MaxMSPProject": This contains projects built in Max/MSP. Within them, you'll find the ".maxpat" file and a compressed text ".pdf". I HIGHLY RECOMMEND uses the ".maxpat" file to open, view, and play with the file. When copied in from the ".pdf", all loadband/loadmess type objects usually do not properly initiate the patch. Unfortunately, you'll need Max/MSP on your computer to do either. In some cases (github upload limits permitting) I have uploaded standalone application versions of the patches, this is the best way to play with the projects in my opinion.

Notes on Max/MSP projects:
  Generative Ambient Home - 
  Paraphonic Motion Synth - 
  Glitch Drone Organ - 
  Random Mutli-Timbral Poly Synth - 
  Pedal-esque FX Environments - 
      Dynamic - 
      Matrix - 
  VoxProcessor - 


Thank you! Have fun, feel free to use however you'd like... any feedback or suggestions are welcomed!
