Files et al for my undergraduate thesis project.

Hello! 

If you're here that probably means that you're one of my professors, one of my friends who was curious, or possibily someone else.

In any case, welcome!

A few housekeeping notes:

All ".scd" files are SuperCollider code. They will run in the SuperCollider IDE (or any other text editor setup w/ sclang, I guess) if they are "copy/pasted" into it and then evaluated after the .fork.

All ".pdf" files are compressed Max patches. To look at them, copy the text, and then open Max. Go to File - New From Clipboard in the top menu to open.

Thank you!
