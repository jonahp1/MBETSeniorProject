Files et al. for my undergraduate thesis project.

Hello! 

Thank you for visiting this repository. All of the attached files/projects are part of a larger project that I completed in partial fulfillment of my undergraduate thesis.

A few housekeeping notes:





Regarding the folder "SuperColliderCode" : All ".scd" files are SuperCollider code. They will run in the SuperCollider IDE. To run, they must be "copy/pasted" into the IDE (or text editor) and then evaluated after the .fork method.

Notes on SC projects:

Noise Resonator - a drone instrument based on filtering pink noise with an extreme Q factor in order to generate "pure" tones. 
    
Granular Pitch Shifter - a live audio processing tool that granulates an input signal, and allows the user to shift up by a pythagorean third or a perfect fifth.
    
Mouse Controller - a very simple program that tracks track pad movement and translates that into control information.

Live Playground - conglomerate environment collected from personal explorations(of varying success), tutorial videos, and demos for the purpose of a "reflexive" live code performance environment. (please note that some of the synthDefs in this program are not of 100% unique origin but have been lifted from demo videos etc, and reimagined in this environment)
  


Regarding Max Patches: all are saved as ".maxpat" files. To open, you'll need Max. Opening directly from the downloaded git repo folder should work.

Notes on Max/MSP projects:

Generative Ambient Home - expanded class project based on generative ambient "drone", good for Eno-esque textures, or a ghostly electrionic Tanpura-esque sound.
 
Paraphonic Motion Synth - sequencer based instrument, that can also be played as a monophonic (paraphonic w/ delays) synthesizer

Glitch Drone Organ - synth enabled for musical typing and showcasing a freaky delay line; good for drones and glitched chords

Random Mutli-Timbral Poly Synth - fm (actually pm, but this is a historic misnomer) based synth with bound random quantization and (relatively) complex enveloping 

VoxProcessor - environment for processing input signal; originally conceptualized as "for voice" but truly can be used for any input signal

The Quad Edits Folder contains all of the above custom Max instruments (not VoxProcessor) mildly adapted to support utilization in Quadrophonic multichannel setup.



Thank you! Any feedback or suggestions are welcomed!
