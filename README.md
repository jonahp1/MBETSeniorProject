Files et al. for my undergraduate thesis project.

Hello! 

Thank you for visiting this repository. All of the attached files/projects are part of a larger project that I completed in partial fulfillment of my undergraduate thesis.

A few housekeeping notes:





Regarding the folder "SuperColliderCode" : All ".scd" files are SuperCollider code. They will run in the SuperCollider IDE (or any other text editor setup w/ sclang, I believe). To run, they must be "copy/pasted" into the IDE (or text editor) and then    evaluated after the .fork method.

Notes on SC projects:

Noise Resonator - a drone instrument based on filtering pink noise with an extreme Q factor in order to generate "pure" tones. 
    
Granular Pitch Shifter - a live audio processing tool that granulates an input signal, and allows the user to shift up by a pythagorean third or a perfect fifth.
    
wtMouse - a very simple program that tracks track pad movement and translates that into control information.

Live Playground - conglomerate environment collected from personal explorations(of varying success), tutorial videos, and demos for the purpose of a "reflexive" live code performance environment. (please note that some of the synthDefs in this program are not of 100% unique origin but have been lifted from demo videos etc, and reimagined in this environment)
  





Regarding the folder "MaxMSPProject": This contains projects built in Max/MSP. Within them, you'll find the ".maxpat" file and a compressed text ".pdf". I HIGHLY RECOMMEND uses the ".maxpat" file to open, view, and play with the file. When copied in from the ".pdf", all loadband/loadmess type objects usually do not properly initiate the patch. Unfortunately, you'll need Max/MSP on your computer to do either. In some cases (github upload limits permitting) I have uploaded standalone application versions of the patches, this is the best way to play with the projects in my opinion.

Notes on Max/MSP projects:

Generative Ambient Home - expanded class project based on generative ambient "drone", good for Eno-esque textures, or a ghostly electrionic Tanpura-esque sound.
 
Paraphonic Motion Synth - sequencer based instrument, that can also be played as a monophonic (paraphonic w/ delays) synthesizer

Glitch Drone Organ - synth enabled for musical typing and showcasing a freaky delay line; good for drones and glitched chords

Random Mutli-Timbral Poly Synth - fm (actually pm, but this is a historic misnomer) based synth with bound random quantization and (relatively) complex enveloping 

VoxProcessor - environment for processing input signal; originally conceptualized as "for voice" but truly can be used for any input signal






Thank you! Any feedback or suggestions are welcomed!
